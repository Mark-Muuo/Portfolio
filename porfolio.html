        <h2>About </h2>
        <p>I'm a passionate student with a strong interest in the fields of web development and cybersecurity. My journey 
           into the world of security started during my academic <br>pursuits, and I am eager to learn, grow, and contribute
            to the security of digital systems and networks. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer 
            Science <br> at Dedan KImathi University of Technology. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in
             network security and web development.Am also a web <br> developer crafts visually captivating and intuitive web applications.I use a diverse set of 
           technologies, programming languages, and frameworks to build websites that<br> not only meet but exceed the needs and expectations of users.
            My passion for web development drives me to create responsive, secure, and dynamic digital experiences that leave a lasting impression.

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>I take great pride in having designed a state-of-the-art ATM (Automated Teller Machine) program that seamlessly integrates <br>
                cutting-edge technology with an intuitive user experience. My ATM program empowers users with the ability to access their <br>
                accounts and conduct a wide range of financial transactions with ease and security. From account balance inquiries to fund transfers <br>
                 and bill payments, every feature has been carefully crafted to offer convenience and efficiency. Robust security measures, such <br>
                 as data encryption and anti-skimming technology, ensure that users' data and transactions remain safeguarded at all times.</p>

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>In a recent project I did I was able to conduct a meticulous port scan on a targeted network. This endeavor required precision and <br> 
                a keen understanding of network reconnaissance. I meticulously specified the IP addresses of the targets and selected the most appropriate scan types, <br>
                such as TCP SYN, to comprehensively explore the network's infrastructure. With Nmap's flexibility, I fine-tuned scan options to uncover open ports and the services <br> 
                running on each system. The results of this endeavor provided invaluable insights into the network's strengths and potential vulnerabilities. Armed with this <br>
                knowledge, I could recommend tailored security measures to fortify the network against potential threats. This hands-on experience underscores my proficiency in <br>
                deploying advanced tools like Nmap for thorough network analysis and security assessment.
